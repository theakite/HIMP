RELEASE CHECKLIST
written by Steve Karg (using a similar doc by Kim Gräsman as a guide)

1. Verify that the build is clean.
  * Test code with clean directory.
  * Get a clean build (no warnings or errors).
  * The program must be functional (it works).
2. Update version number in version.c and rebuild. Is it still functional?
3. Clean up the object files and binaries, and make the source code look 
the same to prepare for tar.
  $ make clean
  $ indent -kr -nut -nlp *.c *.h
4. Commit changes to CVS. Always describe why something is changed in the 
   annotation.  This will automatically go into the changelog.
  $ cvs update
  $ cvs commit
5. Set a CVS tag on the "bacnet" module called "bacnet4linux-0-0-0"
  $ cvs tag "bacnet4linux-0-0-0"
6. tar and gzip the clean directory from one directory up.
  $ tar -cvvzf bacnet4linux-0.0.0.tgz bacnet/
7. Put the new release up on SourceForge
  * Connect to ftp://upload.sourceforge.net/ as anonymous
  * Upload the tarball to the incoming directory.
  * Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet4linux
  * Admin -> File Releases
